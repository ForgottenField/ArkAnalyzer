/*
 * This code relates to a NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476) scenario, demonstrating
 * Address Alias Level complexity. For more details, refer to http://cwe.mitre.org.
 * In this implementation, we attempt to retrieve a simulated system property for a given key,
 * and then remove leading/trailing whitespace. If the simulated property is not found
 * (i.e., the key is unknown), the value will be null. The code includes a check
 * to prevent a null pointer dereference in this scenario, and a generic catch block
 * handles potential runtime errors, similar to how Java might handle SecurityExceptions
 * related to system property access.
